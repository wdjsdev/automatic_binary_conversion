# automatic_binary_conversion
automatic conversion to .jsxbin format. individual file, or a whole project folder.

Just create a folder in your home directory called "automatic_binary_conversion" and plop all these files in there.

then set up some aliases in BASH to run the .sh scripts, or just include them as custom bash functions added by your .bashrc file.

*Note*
In order for the jsxbin_compiler.jsx script to work, Extendscript must be closed. There is an applescript call in the bash scripts to close ESTK for you, but to be safe, save and close your work before you try to convert something.
